### Hi there ðŸ‘‹


My name is Jaime, welcome to my GitHub!

Join me in this wonderful journey. I like building stuff, from 'just for fun' scripts that can do some silly things, or 'functional ones' that can ease my life, 
and I hope, yours too! 

I love solving puzzles and the logic behind them. Programming let us solve all those tedious tasks that can be automated and give a different solution, and that's
why I love it! You use a combination of science, art, and craft to create something unique and wonderful!

**Feedback and reviews are always welcome! Tell me how I can improve my code!**
